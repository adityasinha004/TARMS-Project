Programming Language / Environment Experience
List the languages you are most comfortable developing in, as a team, in your order of
preference. Many of the projects involve Java or C/C++ programming.
1.Web Development
2.Python and C++
3.SQL
Choices of Projects:
Please select 4 projects your team would like to work on, by order of preference: [Write at-least one paragraph for
each choice (motivation, reason for choice, feasibility analysis, etc.)]
Project Name Unique Selling Point
First Choice E-BOOK STORE As usually observed the books needed by
students are usually out of stock in library (i.e.
 already issued by some students). The aim is
to provide E-books to all students so that there

Page 4 of 58
is no hampering of quality education and
students can access any book at any time.
Second Choice PG finder in Patiala This is difficult to find PG in a location
for new comers in Patiala. The aim is to
provide it easier for students to find a perfect
staying location for them according to their
requirements along with the reviews of each
PG.
Third Choice Online shopping from Cos, G-Block
Cafeteria and other shops in TIET
Online delivery of products from within the
campus within half an hour of order will be
helpful for those who are in genuine need and
don’t have the time to travel to cos (or in case
if covid returns).
This saves travelling time of students and
even cost because if they purchase from any
other website (like Amazon, Flipkart, Zomato
etc.) then they have to pay additional delivery
charges which is around Rs.70
Fourth Choice Clone for Myntra With increased inclusivity(more appropriate
size chart) example for jeans accurate thighs
size which is not in original app.
Additional Remarks/ Inputs
Please tell us about any other factors that we should take into consideration (e.g., if you really would like to work
on a project for some particularly convincing reason).
………………………………………………………………………………………………
We would love to be able to work on the first two projects, since we genuinely believe that it
would help not just us but also other students in solving a few very basic but important
problems.

The goal is to design a software for Thapar students to provide E-books to them, so that there
is no hampering of quality education and students can access any book at any time. In this
system a student can read and download the book for a particular subject according to his/her
year and branch in pdf format. They will also be able to view the required books on the basis
of author name and book name and they will also able to read and download journal and
admin can add book, journal, user and delete book, journal, user. In this system, both student
and admin can use the system only when they are logged in to system. They can login to
system by entering correct email id and password. Only Admin is able to give access to

1.Introduction
1.1 Purpose of this Document
The purpose of this SRS document is to provide a detailed overview of our software
product, its parameters and goals. This document describes the project's target audience
and its user interface, hardware and software requirements.
It defines how our client, team and audience see the product and its functionality.
1.2 Scope of the Development Project

Page 24 of 58
The goal is to design a software for Thapar students to provide E-books to them, so that there
is no hampering of quality education and students can access any book at any time. In this
system a student can read and download the book for a particular subject according to his/her
year and branch in pdf format. They will also be able to view the required books on the basis
of author name and book name and they will also able to read and download journal and
admin can add book, journal, user and delete book, journal, user. In this system, both student
and admin can use the system only when they are logged in to system. They can login to
system by entering correct email id and password. Only Admin is able to give access to
student i.e.  only admin will give email id and password to respective student.
The software would be able to perform the following operations:
    1.  Easy access to Book :- The software would be able to allow the students of Thapar
         University to avail the books of particular subject according to their years and branches.
    2. Download Book :- By pressing the download button we can download the book and access
       that book offline.
   
    3. Read and Download Journal :- The software would be able to allow the students to read  
           
        and download Journals.
    4. Add Student :- Admin can add new student to system by entering his/her email address
and
        Password. Then Student’s data will be stored in user database and that student will be able
to    
        access the system by logging into system. During login, student has to put only that email
        address and password which is provided by the Admin.
    5. Add Book :- Admin can add new book and giving all the details of that book like book
name,
       Book Author, Publication, subject and that book will be visible to all registered students in  
                             
       respective book’s subject section.

Page 25 of 58
    6. Add Journal :- Admin can add new journal and giving all the details of that journal like
        Journal name, Journal Author and that journal will be visible to all registered students.
    7. Delete User :- Admin can delete any student details from database and that student will
        not be able to access software.
       
     8. Delete Book :- Admin can also delete any book from software system by going to book  
          details section where admin can view book also.
 
     8. Delete Journal :- Admin can also delete any journal from software system by going to
        Journal details section where admin can view journal also.

The following list presents the constraints, assumptions, dependencies or guidelines that
are imposed upon our software “Book Spot”.
●  The software must conform to Thapar Institute of Engineering and
Technology disclaimer policy.
● Due to the small form factor, only limited number of books are made
available currently.
● There are memory requirements in case of download of books.
● The product will have an interface that is simple enough for all types of
users to understand.
● Response time for loading the software should be no longer than ten
seconds.
● A general knowledge of basic computer skills is required to use the product.
● Since the “Book Spot” is only accessible through the internet, it is assumed
that the end user has a connection to the internet. It is also assumed that the
user has a web browser able to display the website.
