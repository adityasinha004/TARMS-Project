Auditorium and Room Management System (TARMS)</h2>
<hr />
<h3 id="purpose-and-scope">1. Purpose and Scope</h3>
<p>The goal is to manage room and auditorium bookings, approvals, and
scheduling for Thapar Institute of Engineering &amp; Technology. The
system will serve students, faculty, and administrators. The primary
outcome is to reduce manual booking processes and waiting time while
improving accuracy of room allocation and scheduling.</p>
<h3 id="stakeholders-and-user-classes">2. Stakeholders and User
Classes</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Student</strong>: Undergraduate and graduate students who
request room bookings for events, meetings, or activities.</li>
<li><strong>Faculty</strong>: Teaching staff who approve/reject booking
requests and manage room allocations.</li>

<h3 id="system-context-high-level">3. System Context (High Level)</h3>
<p>The system connects to the university’s student/faculty database for
authentication, stores booking data and user profiles in MongoDB, and
provides web-based interfaces for room management. It integrates with
the university’s existing infrastructure and follows institutional
policies for room allocation.</p>

members.</li>
<li>Booking data must be retained for audit purposes for three
years.</li>
<li>Normal usage supports up to two hundred concurrent users.</li>
<li>System must operate during university business hours (8 AM to 8
PM).</li>

accesses the home page, the system shall display all rooms with their
current status (Available, Booked, On Hold) within two seconds. - The
system shall show Room Number, Room Name, Status, and a “Book Now”
button for available rooms.</p>
<p><strong>FR-5. Booking Request Creation</strong> - When a student
selects an available room and submits a booking form, the system shall
collect event details including Room Name, Event Name, Purpose, Date,
Time, Number of People, and Requirements (AC, Sound System). - The
system shall create a booking request with “Requested” status and store
it in the database.</p>
<p><strong>FR-6. Faculty Approval Process</strong> - When a faculty
member logs in, the system shall display all booking requests with “On
Hold” status. - When a faculty member approves or rejects a request, the
system shall update the request status and notify the student within
five seconds.</p>
<p><strong>FR-7. Booking History</strong> - When a student accesses “My
Requests”, the system shall display all booking requests made by that
student with their current status. - The system shall allow students to
delete their own pending requests.</p>
<p><strong>FR-8. Personal Information Management</strong> - When a user
accesses personal information, the system shall display their current
details. - When a user updates their information, the system shall
validate and save the changes to the database.</p>
<p><strong>FR-9. Password Management</strong> - When a user changes
their password, the system shall verify the current password and update
to the new password. - When a user requests password reset, the system
shall log the request for administrative processing.</p>
<p><strong>FR-10. Contact and Feedback</strong> - When a user submits
contact information or feedback, the system shall store the data with
timestamp for administrative review.</p>
<h3 id="quality-attributes-measurable-targets">7. Quality Attributes
(Measurable Targets)</h3>
<p><strong>Performance</strong>: Under normal load of two hundred
concurrent users, page response time shall be under three seconds for
ninety-five percent of requests and under five seconds for ninety-nine
percent of requests.</p>
<p><strong>Availability</strong>: The service shall be available
ninety-nine percent of the time during business hours (8 AM to 8 PM),
excluding scheduled maintenance announced at least twenty-four hours in
advance.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong>: All user sessions shall timeout after
fifteen minutes of inactivity. Access to faculty features shall require
explicit faculty role assignment. All booking actions shall be recorded
with user ID, timestamp, and action details.</p>
<p><strong>Usability</strong>: A new student shall be able to search for
a room and submit a booking request without training, completing the
task within five minutes during a standard usability study with at least
ten participants.</p>
<p><strong>Accessibility</strong>: The web interface shall support

<h3 id="acceptance-criteria-and-test-ideas">10. Acceptance Criteria and
Test Ideas</h3>

credentials redirects to student dashboard within three seconds; invalid
credentials show error message.</p>
<p><strong>Booking Request</strong>: A student can successfully submit a
booking request for an available room; the request appears in faculty
approval queue with “On Hold” status.</p>
<p><strong>Faculty Approval</strong>: A faculty member can approve a
booking request; the request status changes to “Approved” and the room
status updates to “Booked”.</p>
<p><strong>Session Management</strong>: User session expires after
fifteen minutes of inactivity; user is redirected to login page when
accessing protected routes.</p>
<p><strong>Data Validation</strong>: System prevents duplicate User IDs
and Email addresses during registration; form validation ensures
